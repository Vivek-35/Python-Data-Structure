        "3. What are the main differences betwen lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "   - Lists are mutable, allowing modification after creation, while tuples\n",
        "     are immutable and cannot be changed. Lists have dynamic memory allocation, making them slower, whereas tuples are faster due to static memory allocation. Lists use more memory, while tuples are more memory-efficient.\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "   - Dictionaries in Python store data as key-value pairs using a hash\n",
        "     table internally. Each key is hashed to generate an index, allowing for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions. Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, or tuples), while values can be of any data type. This structure enables efficient data retrieval in constant time, on average.\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "   - A set is used instead of a list when we need unique elements and\n",
        "     fast lookups. Sets automatically remove duplicates and provide O(1) average time complexity for membership tests, whereas lists require O(n) search time. However, sets are unordered, unlike lists, which maintain element order.\n",
        "6. What is a string in python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "   - A string in Python is an immutable sequence of characters, while a\n",
        "     list is a mutable collection of elements (which can be of any data type). Strings cannot be modified in place, whereas lists can be changed dynamically. Additionally, lists support operations like item reassignment and removal, which strings do not.\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "   - Tuples ensure data integrity in Python by being immutable, meaning\n",
        "     their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed after creation. This prevents accidental modifications, making tuples ideal for storing constant data, ensuring reliability, and enhancing security in applications where data consistency is crucial.\n",
        "8. What is a hash table and, how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "   - A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs using a\n",
        "     hashing function to map keys to unique indices for fast retrieval. In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, allowing O(1) average-time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions. Each key is hashed to determine its storage location, ensuring efficient data access.\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "   - Yes, lists in Python can contain different data types. A single list  can store integers, floats, strings, booleans, other lists, tuples,\n",
        "     dictionaries, or even custom objects, making them highly flexible.\n",
        "     For example:\n",
        "     my_list = [10, \"hello\", 3.14, True, [1, 2, 3], {\"key\": \"value\"}]\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "    - Strings are immutable in Python to enhance performance, security,\n",
        "      and memory efficiency. Since strings are widely used, immutability allows Python to optimize memory usage by interning (reusing common strings). It also ensures thread safety, preventing unintended modifications. Any change to a string creates a new object instead of modifying the original.\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain task?\n",
        "    - Dictionaries offer faster lookups (O(1) average time complexity)\n",
        "      using keys, while lists require O(n) search time. They allow key-value pairing, making data retrieval more intuitive. Dictionaries are ideal for tasks needing quick access, unique keys, and structured data, whereas lists are better for ordered sequences.\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over lists.\n",
        "    - A tuple is preferable over a list when data integrity and\n",
